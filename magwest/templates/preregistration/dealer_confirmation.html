    <h2>{% if group.status == c.WAITLISTED %}You've been added to our waitlist!{% else %}Thanks for applying as a Dealer!{% endif %}</h2>

    We've received your application for {{ group.name }} to purchase a Dealer registration for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.

    <br/><br/>
    {% if group.status == c.WAITLISTED %}
        Since the Marketplace is currently full, you've been added to our waitlist, and we'll let you know if a spot opens up for you.
    {% else %}
      We anticipate receiving many applications this year, and application processing take a considerable amount of time.
      Approvals will be sent as promptly as possible, and you will hear back no later than <strong>two months</strong> before the event.
      If you have not heard back by this time, you may email {{ c.MARKETPLACE_EMAIL|email_only|email_to_link }} to inquire about your application status.
    {% endif %}

    <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
    After approval, you will be emailed a link to manage your dealer registration. From this link, you will be able to:
    <ul>
        <li>Pay for your dealer registration, which includes the cost of tables and badges.</li>
        <li>Register your Dealer Assistants.</li>
        <li>After your badge and table payment is received, you may add and pay for additional Dealer Assistants.</li>
    </ul>

    Your Dealership Payment includes your table cost and all badges in your group.  After payment, you'll be sent a link
    by email to follow if you wish to later upgrade your badge. Your Dealer Assistants will be able to upgrade their own
    badges and pay for those upgrades on their own.

    <br/><br/>Later, you will receive another email with more specific information about this year's event.

    <br/><br/>In the event we cannot accommodate your Dealership, you will receive an email. If your application
    is not approved, you will be able to purchase badges for yourself and the number of assistants on the application
    at the lowest possible pre-registration price available at the date of this application based on available promo codes. 
    You will receive an email when these badges are available for purchase.
