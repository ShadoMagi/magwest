{{ attendee.first_name }},

Thanks so much for helping run MAGWest last year--we couldn't have pulled it off without so much help from our wonderful volunteers. Prep for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} is already underway, and this year it's happening {{ c.EPOCH|datetime_local("%b %e") }} - {{ c.ESCHATON|datetime_local("%e") }} at {{ c.EVENT_VENUE }}! As thanks for your help last time, you're eligible for a complimentary {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Staff badge, which you can accept by visiting {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}

After you accept your badge, you'll be emailed when shifts become available. Also, as a returning volunteer you can request space in our staff hotel room block. You'll be emailed closer to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} with details about how to do so.

If you want to come to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} but don't want to volunteer again, just let us know and we'll swap your Staff badge for a complimentary Attendee badge instead.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
