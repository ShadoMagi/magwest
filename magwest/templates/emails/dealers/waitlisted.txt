Dear {{ c.DEALER_TERM }} 

Thank you for submitting your dealer's application to MAGWest. We appreciate your interest in our event and thank you for considering us as an avenue for your business.

After careful review and consideration, we have decided to place your submission on a waitlist. This means that while we are unable to accept your submission at this time, we may consider it in the future should a suitable opportunity arise. Although we cannot accept all submissions received, we were astounded by the number of unique and wonderful entries that were sent in.

Please note that sometimes opportunities arise at the last minute, and we may need to make a decision quickly. In the event that a spot becomes available for your business, we will notify you as soon as possible, which may be as little as a day before the event.

Regardless of your status, we welcome you to attend the event and hope to see you there!

Best regards,
{{ c.MARKETPLACE_EMAIL_SIGNATURE }}
