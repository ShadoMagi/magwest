<p>Hello there! Thank you for submitting your dealer's application for this year's MAGWest Marketplace. Your group ({{ group.name }}) has been approved as a {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Dealer for this coming {{ event_dates() }}!</p>

<p>By proceeding with the purchase of your table(s), you are implicitly agreeing to comply with both the MAGWest Marketplace agreement and the event's <a href="{{ c.CODE_OF_CONDUCT_URL }}" target="_blank">code of conduct</a>. To view the MAGWest Marketplace agreement and purchase your approved tables, go ahead and pay the ${{ group.cost }} you owe using the credit card button <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}">on this page</a>.</p>

<p>Payment is expected by: {{ c.DEALER_PAYMENT_DUE|datetime_local }}.  Failure to pay by this date may result in removal of your application and your tables being filled by another applicant.</p>

{% if group.unassigned_badges %}<p>Some of your badges are not yet assigned to a specific person. If you assign these badges now then it will take much less time for their owners to pick them up at the festival. You may do this by <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}">clicking here</a>.</p>{% endif %}

<p>This registration includes:
