Thank you for submitting your panel, "{{ app.name }}", for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} {{ c.EVENT_YEAR }}.  {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} is growing and changing every year, and due to our time and space constraints we have to decline the majority of submissions that we receive, including many we wish we could accept.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough space in our schedule this year to accommodate your panel.

Regardless, we still would love to see you at MAGWest as you're welcomed to enjoy the event. There are many opportunities to get involved (whether performing, jamming, or hanging) so please make sure to monitor our social media for when an opportunity arises.

Finally, as always, we encourage you to please apply again next year!

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to send them to {{ c.PANELS_EMAIL|email_only }}.
