<h1>Volunteer Agreement</h1>

<p><strong>
This Volunteer Agreement has two sections; one is legal and the other is cultural. In the state of California, we're required by law to explain the exchange of perks for volunteer hours. Please note that "Provided Services" is where we'd typically say "volunteer".
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Beyond that, it's important to us that you understand volunteer expectations, as well as what you can expect from MAGFest. Read on!</strong></p>

            <b>Miscellaneous.</b>
            This Agreement and all performance under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California,
            without regard to conflict of law principles. In any dispute relating to this Agreement,
            the parties hereto admit venue and submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts
            located in Los Angeles County, California. Volunteer's remedy, if any, for any breach of this Agreement shall be
            solely in damages, and Volunteer shall not be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise.
            In the event any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable by a court or
            other body of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement shall be construed as if such provision has been more narrowly
            drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be
            effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties, and no such waiver will result in the waiver of any
            other provision of this Agreement. Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement
            will not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or parts thereof.
            In performing the Services, Volunteer will act and represent itself as an independent volunteer and not as an employee
            or agent of the Company. Volunteer has no authority to obligate the Company by contract or otherwise.
            Volunteer may not assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the advance written consent of the Company,
            which may be withheld in its sole discretion. The Company may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in its
            sole discretion. This Agreement is the parties' final, exclusive and complete understanding and agreement, and supersedes
            all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
            This Agreement may be amended only by a writing signed by both parties. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
            which, when taken together, will constitute one Agreement.

        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Performance Problems and Disciplinary Actions</strong></p>
        
        <p>
        In general, volunteers can receive verbal or written warnings of unacceptable behavior or performance and are allowed time and support to improve.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        MAGFest supports an atmosphere of open discussion of issues between volunteers, staff, and employees. Should a volunteer take exception to a disciplinary action, they may discuss it with the head(s) of STOPS for their event. In the case that further arbitration is needed, the Director of Volunteer Infrastructure will have final say on disciplinary actions regarding volunteers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In instances of gross misconduct, warnings may not be possible or desirable for the overall interests of MAGFest, event attendees, or the community. Engaging in any of the following behaviors or actions will not be tolerated and may result in immediate termination of duties:    
        <ul>
            <li>Physical assault or threat of violence to anyone involved with the event.</li>
            <li>Theft (equipment, supplies, money).</li>
            <li>Possession or use of a weapon.</li>
            <li>Racial, sexual, or other harassment of anyone involved with the event.</li>
            <li>Reckless or deliberate action that endangers the physical or psychological well-being of another person involved with the event.</li>

            <li>Reckless or deliberate action which damages the reputation of MAGFest.</li>
