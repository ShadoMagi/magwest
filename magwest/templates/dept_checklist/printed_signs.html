<h2>Room Signage for {{ department.name }}</h2>

<form method="post" action="form">
<p>All attendee-facing rooms will automatically receive either a 24"x36" coroplast for outside of the room. Please submit requests for <strong>additional</strong> signage here.</p>

<p>We will compare all requests against our known signage inventory, so please include your complete list of needs. Please check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JSpM_CzbLM2vEC46DG03c3xq1oF5pdbMwq55MNg6y0Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">current signage inventory</a> and request accordingly. (If you store any signs with your department supplies, however, we will not have records of them in our signage inventory, so DONâ€™T include those here--this helps us avoid double-ordering.)</p>

<p>Signage comes in two types: 12"x18" coroplast and 24"x36" coroplast. Be sure to specify FOR EACH SIGN:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number needed</li>
    <li>Size of sign</li>
    <li>Primary text of sign</li>
    <li>Sub text of sign (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Intended placement location for sign</li>
    <li>Link to any custom artwork that is needed</li>
    <li>Any additional notes</li>
</ul>

<p>The signage department reserves the right to reduce or decline requests according to their discretion. We will contact you if significant changes to your order are necessary.</p>

<p>Note: This checklist item is NOT for printed materials such as sign-up forms, waivers, or anything else that goes on standard office paper. STOPS has a paper cutter and a printer for small jobs (less than 50 pages). Anything more than 50 pages needs to go into the Bulk Print Jobs checklist item.</p>
