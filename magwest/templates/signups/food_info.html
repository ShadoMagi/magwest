We feed our volunteers three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, so you can drop by the Staff Suite in the Retreat building on the 3rd floor in Retreat I (across the hall from Room 324) for food at anytime during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} for a snack or drink. Meals will be served at the following times:
<br/>

<br/> Breakfast: 7:00am to 11:00am
<br/> Lunch: 12:00pm to 4:00pm
<br/> Dinner: 5:00pm to 9:00pm
<br/> Overnight: 9:00pm to 4:00am (or until the hot food has run out, whichever occurs first)

    <br/> <br/>
    You will become eligible for food after working your first shift if you have signed up for at least 12 hours. Please come to Staffing Ops (in the Fest Ops room) after you first get your badge to get your shift schedule, and then come back to get your ribbon marked after working your first shift and getting your department head to sign your sheet. You will not be able to get snacks, drinks, or meals, or have food delivered without your volunteer ribbon being properly marked.
{% endif %}

<br/> <br/>
The first meal served will be breakfast on Friday morning, and the suite will remain open through Sunday afternoon. Sunday will have a breakfast option, but once breakfast is over, leftovers will be served. You will be able to help yourself. Please feel free to bring tupperware or storage bags to carry items home. You will be responsible for their proper storage.

<br/> <br/>
If you are working load in on Thursday night, there will be a meal late that night starting around 9pm. This meal is only for those who are scheduled for load in shifts. Those that are not scheduled for load in shifts may begin receiving meals Friday morning at 7am.

<br/> <br/>
You will also have the option to have food delivered to you while on shift. This option is primarily for those staffers and volunteers who are unable to visit the suite during meal service.
